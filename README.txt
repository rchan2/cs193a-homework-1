Random Number Guessing Game - This app randomly generates a number between (0) and (n) where (n) is the value of the SeekBar, and when the user submits his/her guess, the app compares the two.

(This app error checks for invalue Integer entries in the EditText!)

If the user guessed correctly, their score goes up by 1 and some result text (now green) shows them a congratulations text.

If the user guessed incorrectly, their score goes down by 1 and some result text (now red) shows them a "you guessed wrong" message along with the value the computer actually generated.
